        I have been enjoying the learning procoess for the software development degree for the past year.
        Before this I have been learning how to run my own buisness from my father along with a trade.
        For the past six years I have been learning how to install carpet as an apprentice carpet installer.

        I love to exercise and game. But first and formost I love to read. It is probably the thing I love to do the most.
        Just got into the warhammer francise along with all the nitty gritty lore that it has.
