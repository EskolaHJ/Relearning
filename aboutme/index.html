        I have been enjoying the learning procoess for the software development degree for the past year.
        Before this I have been learning how to run my own buisness from my father along with a trade.
        For the past six years I have been learning how to install carpet as an apprentice carpet installer.

        I love to exercise and game. But first and formost I love to read. It is probably the thing I love to do the most.
        Just got into the warhammer francise along with all the nitty gritty lore that it has. I just recently got several new books.
        Started my journey in collecting books again. At one point I had a collection of 100 books.

        The advantage that I see with learning this degree is the freedom from physical labor. Along with being able to freelance work.
        It also allows me to learn new and amazing skills that will help with logical thinking and processing. If I decide to continue
        into a software engineering degree or if I decide to go into law school to become a lawyer.

        A huge hobby of mine when I have the funds is to go fishing. The breeze and water help balance one away from technology.
        It helps center me when I feel overwhelmed along with getting that much needed sunlight.
